## 📌 Overview

**LIMS-GT** is a modular, research-grade Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) designed to support **gene cloning**, **genetic transformation**, and **molecular biology workflows** in academic and research labs. It is tailored for use by **students, researchers, and supervisors** working on high-throughput or optimization-heavy experiments.

Unlike generic LIMS platforms, LIMS-GT supports **protocol versioning**, **experiment optimization tracking**, **supervision dashboards**, and **construct-to-plantlet traceability** — all in one extensible system.

## 🌟 Key Features

- 🔬 **Gene-to-Plant Traceability**: Track genetic constructs from vector design to regenerated plantlets.
- 🧪 **PCR & Cloning Workflow Logs**: Log, annotate, and optimize all molecular steps.
- 🧬 **Transformation Event Logger**: Record and monitor bacterial or plant transformation events.
- 📈 **Molecular Confirmation Integration**: Store gel images, qPCR results, and sequencing reads.
- 🧾 **Protocol Version Control**: Full changelogs and protocol evolution per experiment.
- 👩‍🏫 **Supervision & Academic Logging**: Built-in project journals, flags, and thesis integration.
- 📊 **Visual Analytics**: Success rates, optimization curves, line tracking, etc.
- 🧠 **Smart Suggestions**: AI-based prompts for optimizing experimental conditions (in development).
- 🔒 **Role-Based Access**: Researchers, supervisors, technicians, and external collaborators.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Django (Python), PostgreSQL
- **API**: Django REST Framework
- **Frontend**: React (or Django templates for MVP), Tailwind CSS
- **DevOps**: Docker, GitHub Actions
- **Storage**: Local filesystem or S3-compatible for experiment media
